I started to learn Machine Learning before this, and now given an opportunity where I can learn computer vision for image pre-processing and path optimization and then apply ML to this is an incredibly interesting opportunity.<br>
Also the captivating technology of space exploration fascinates me, especially as this project aligns with ISRO's potential implementation of the proposed Mars rover idea if it proves effective.<b>
I eagerly anticipate working on this project.
